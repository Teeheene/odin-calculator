# Calculator

This project is a calculator a simple calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions written in **infix notation**  
(e.g., `3 + 4 * (2 - 1)`) using a **Two-Stack Algorithm**.

## Features

- basic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- decimals
- basic error handling

## Stack

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## How It Works

The algorithm uses two stacks:

- **Value Stack** → stores numbers (operands)
- **Operator Stack** → stores operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)

## Inspiration 
This is the final project under foundations for the Odin project, and I thought to do something special by applying what I've learned in class. I took inspiration from my algorithm class, where we learned a lot about in- pre- and postfix expressions, and mainly how to evaluate them. I found that this project is the perfect way to implement what I've learned from that class. I figured instead of implementing a basic calculator that takes two operand and one operator at a time, why not allow users to input a whole expression and allow a PEMDAS evaluation.
